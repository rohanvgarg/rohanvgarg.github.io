	I was inspired to add this section after seeing this on the homepage of a good friend of mine,<a href="https://vmmadathil.github.io/" target = "_blank"> Visakh Madathil</a>. In his words: "I want failure to be more widely celebrated. I truly believe that hiding failures and only highlighting success contributes to imposter syndrome and lower self-confidence. I hope that sharing my failures will help reduce some of the stigma around failing. It's okay to fail." I wholeheartedly agree with him and could not have said it better myself (quite literally).<br>
<br>
<i>Matrix Compuations Course at UT</i>: During my second year at UT, I took a Linear Algebra course at UT. Throughout the course, I struggled with the material and ultimately had to drop the course late on in the semester. I failed to reach out the teaching staff during and devoted more of my time to my other courses and responsibilities. I retook the course the following semester. <br>
<br>
<i>Microsoft Research Internship</i>: I applied to be a research intern at MSR for two summers in a row. I was rejected both times. <br>
<br>
I hope that if you are reading this, you consider adding a section like this to your webpage too. :)
